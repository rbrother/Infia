\maketitle

A software package for spectrum rotational analysis is described. The Infia
program features multiple simultaneous views to the analysis data, including a
spectrum view with assignment markers, a Loomis-Wood type view and lists of
assignments, bands and vibrational states. Automatic combination difference
prediction and parameter calculation are included for linear molecules, but
the program can be also used to assign spectra for symmetric top molecules.
The interactive nature of the program combined with high level of
automatization makes possible rapid and reliable analysis even for difficult
spectra with many overlapping bands and high density of peaks.
