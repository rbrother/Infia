Thank you for your interest in my fitting program.  

At the moment I am busily writing some preliminary users manual for the program, 
and preparing a package for distribution with FTP. This should be ready in a few days 
and I will write you then to tell the download location and installation instructions.

Dear Robert Brotherus,
           on the recent conference on high res. mol. spectroscopy in
Glasgow I noted the poster H25 on DCCBr by you, Vaittinen, and Halonen.
O.Vaitt. told me that the Loomis-Wood program used for a poster picture
had been written by you, as far as he knew independently of previous
L.-W. programs.
           For many years I have been involved in spectroscopy using the
L.-W. technique, and I should like to hear more about your approach to
the problem - eventually a copy of your program, if you have a final
version. In return I can offer a copy of our L.-W. program as described
in J.Mol.Spectrosc. 152, 206 (1992). The program is for MS-DOS on IBM-
type Pc.s.
           Best regards:
                                       Flemming Winther

Dear Dr. Brotherus,

	It was very nice to meet you and see and discuss your posters at the 
High resolution spectroscopy conference at Prague in August 1998. I am very 
impressed about your work, posters and the software program for analysis of the  
vibration-rotation spectra. Will you please send me the computer program and 
zerox copy of the posters explaning the program in detail. I will also be very 
grateful if you could send me the zerox copy of the posters of theory part of 
the analysis of the linear molecules.
	
	Thanking you very much and hope to hear from you.
	
Sincerely,

Rohidas Kshirsagar

I have sent a reprint to the address you gave.

Please find the program installation package at

I have heard of this approach (perhaps in Prague98 conference?) 
It was interesting. As you might be aware, Infia also uses conbination 
differences for assignments (as described in the article).

We certainly don't have that journal and I would be 
interested in this article, so please send me a reprint. Address is:

Thank you for your interest in INFIA spectrum analysis software. You can
download the latest version from:

http://fkassistant.pc.helsinki.fi/infia/download.html

Please note that I have moved to work in the industry about 2 years ago
and do not actively support or develop infia further.
